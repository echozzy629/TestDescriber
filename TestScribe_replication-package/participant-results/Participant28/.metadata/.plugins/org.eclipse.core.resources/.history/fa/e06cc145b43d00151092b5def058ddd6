/*
 * The following test cases have been automatically generated using EvoSuite. 
 * These unit tests contain assertions that reflect the current behavior of the  
 * class under test (Rational.java). However, since the class under test is faulty 
 * (i.e., there are bugs), the generated assertions may wrongly reflect the 
 * incorrect behavior. Therefore, the assertions need to be analyzed and fixed. 
 * Feel free to remove assertions or to @Ignore tests you do not understand.
 *
 * Notes on Testing: There are bugs in Rational.java. A test revealing a bug should 
 * fail. Tests not revealing bugs should pass. To this aim you can add/remove and modify
 * test cases. You may fix obvious bugs, but do not waste time debugging.
